# Insurance JUnit Test Suite
 Testing suite using JUnit 

 This is an example of code refactoring in Java. The original code can be found in the Insurance.java file. 
 This code was taken and refactored into 3 other classes to handle the aspects of the testing. 3 testing classes are available 
 in the program. When running the Test Suite, there is no need to enter any information, the code has possible scenarios for each one.
 The test unti can be run from the SuiteTester.java class and the main program can be run from the Runner.java class.
